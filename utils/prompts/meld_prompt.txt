Decide whether the speaker feels good, neutral, or bad and give the reason. Examples:

Utterance: I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.

Feeling: Good because I feel grateful to be given the opportunity.

Utterance: Are you travelling with a child?

Feeling: Good because I won the game.

Utterance: Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.

Utterance: Oh, yeah, well you know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
Feeling: Neutral because I just state a fact.

Utterance: You don't plan these things.
Feeling:
