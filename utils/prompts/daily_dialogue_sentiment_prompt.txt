Decide whether the speaker's emotion is positive, neutral, or negative and give the reason. Examples:

Utterance: It was a nightmare.
Feeling: Negative because "nightmare" means something is very frightening and unpleasant.

Utterance: I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing.
Feeling: Negative because "tired of" means unhappy with something and "wearing others' clothes" is rude.

Utterance: Really? I didn't know that it was against company policy.
Feeling: Negative because "really" is used to express surprise or disbelief and "against company policy" is an unexpected behavior.

Utterance: Brian, may I have a pleasure to have a dance with you? 
Feeling: Neutral because it's just a request and nothing is related to emotions.

Utterance: I think you look fantastic. Happy Birthday!
Feeling: Positive because I complimented him and make a wish he is happy on birthday.

Utterance:  A small bag. I guess we also need a few oranges.
Feeling: Neutral because I just make a guess and noting is related to emotions.
