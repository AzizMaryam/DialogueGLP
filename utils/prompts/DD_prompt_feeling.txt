The following is a conversation.

Other: Hey Lydia, what are you reading?
I:  I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month! My outlook is very positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, and that I will have a passionate summer fling!
Other:  What are you talking about? Let me see that... What are horoscopes?
I:  It ’ s a prediction of your month, based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, so I ’ m an Aries. When were you born?
Other:  January 5th.
I:  Let ’ s see... you're a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers!
Other:  That's bogus. I don't feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.

What do I feel now and why?
