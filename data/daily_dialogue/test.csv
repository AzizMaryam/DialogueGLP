556,63,0,"Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? ",no emotion,3
557,63,1," Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . ",no emotion,3
558,63,2," Yeah , that's very important . ",no emotion,4
559,63,3," So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . ",no emotion,3
560,63,4, I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . ,no emotion,4
561,63,5," That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . ",no emotion,3
562,63,6, It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . ,no emotion,4
563,63,7," It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . ",no emotion,3
564,63,8, But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . ,no emotion,4
565,63,9," I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . ",no emotion,3
566,63,10, It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . ,no emotion,4
567,63,11," You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . ",no emotion,3
568,63,12, I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . ,no emotion,4
569,63,13, You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . ,no emotion,3
570,63,14, It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . ,no emotion,4
571,63,15," It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . ",no emotion,3
572,64,0,"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? ",no emotion,2

4140,514,2," Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . ",no emotion,1
4141,514,3," No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? ",no emotion,3
4142,514,4," Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like . ",no emotion,4

4148,515,1, I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills . ,no emotion,1
4149,515,2," It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . ",no emotion,1
4150,515,3, Is that true ? ,surprise,2
4151,515,4, Definitely ! ,no emotion,1
4152,515,5," If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone . ",no emotion,1
4153,516,0,"Hello sir , how may I help you ? ",no emotion,2
4154,516,1," I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . ",no emotion,3
4155,516,2," I see , may I ask what the occasion is ? ",no emotion,3
4156,516,3," It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry . ",no emotion,4
4157,516,4, Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . ,no emotion,3
4158,516,5, I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ? ,no emotion,4
4159,516,6," Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you . ",no emotion,3

4172,518,0,How do you think they could be ended ? ,no emotion,2
4173,518,1, I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . ,no emotion,1
4174,518,2," So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them . ",no emotion,1
4175,518,3," It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . ",no emotion,1
4176,518,4," Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . ",no emotion,1

4187,521,2, And it takes up all the news . ,no emotion,1
4188,521,3, The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . ,no emotion,1
4189,521,4," It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . ",no emotion,1
4190,521,5, Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio . ,no emotion,1
4191,521,6, I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio . ,no emotion,1

4205,523,5, I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good . ,no emotion,1
4206,523,6, Maybe I should try looking on the web for work . ,no emotion,1
4207,523,7, Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . ,no emotion,3
4208,523,8, But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . ,no emotion,4
4209,523,9, How do you know if you don ’ t have a try ? ,no emotion,3
4210,524,0,Would you please show me the necklace in the window ? ,no emotion,3

4419,553,0,The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . ,no emotion,1
4420,553,1, Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . ,no emotion,2
4421,553,2," No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . ",no emotion,1
4422,553,3," You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? ",no emotion,2
4423,553,4," Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . ",no emotion,1
4424,553,5, Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? ,no emotion,2
4425,553,6," Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . ",no emotion,1
4426,553,7, Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? ,no emotion,2
4427,553,8," Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . ",happiness,1
4428,554,0,Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? ,no emotion,3
4429,554,1," We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . ",no emotion,2
4430,554,2," You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . ",no emotion,3
4431,554,3," OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? ",no emotion,2
4432,554,4," I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .

4450,557,3," Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . ",no emotion,1
4451,557,4," Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . ",no emotion,1
4452,557,5," Ok , then we can sign up for it together . ",no emotion,3
4453,558,0,Who's it knocking at the door ? ,no emotion,2

4472,561,1, If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . ,no emotion,3
4473,561,2, What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . ,no emotion,1
4474,561,3, I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? ,no emotion,3

7005,895,4," Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? ",no emotion,2
7006,895,5," You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . ",no emotion,1
7007,895,6," Well , that seems easy enough . ",no emotion,1
7008,895,7," Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . ",no emotion,1
7009,895,8, Geez . Is that all ? ,no emotion,2
7010,895,9," Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! ",no emotion,1

7076,905,6, Why ? ,no emotion,2
7077,905,7, We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . ,no emotion,1
7078,905,8, But I want to burn up more calories ! ,no emotion,1

7093,907,0,"It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . ",no emotion,1
7094,907,1, The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . ,no emotion,1
7095,907,2," Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . ",no emotion,1
7096,907,3," It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . ",no emotion,1

7103,908,6, I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . ,no emotion,3
7104,908,7, That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? ,happiness,2
7105,908,8, Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . ,happiness,4

7546,973,1, I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . ,no emotion,1
7547,973,2," Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . ",no emotion,1

7557,974,6, What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? ,no emotion,2
7558,974,7, Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . ,no emotion,1

7567,975,4, And your parents took it badly ? ,no emotion,2
7568,975,5, That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . ,no emotion,1
7569,975,6," Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? ",no emotion,2
7570,975,7," She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . ",no emotion,1
7571,975,8, How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? ,no emotion,2
7572,975,9, Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . ,no emotion,1
7573,975,10, Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . ,surprise,2
7574,975,11, What do you mean ? ,no emotion,2
7575,975,12," Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . ",no emotion,1
7576,975,13," I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . ",no emotion,1
7577,976,0,Do you think they two will get married ? ,happiness,2

7583,977,1, He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone . ,no emotion,1
7584,977,2, Why do you say that ? ,no emotion,2
7585,977,3," Whatever things get tough , he gives in . ",no emotion,1
7586,978,0,Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight . ,no emotion,1
