710,82,1," Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . ",no emotion,4
711,82,2," Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . ",surprise,2
712,82,3, Do you sell direct to shops ? ,no emotion,2

714,82,5, Do you keep a stock of these things ? ,no emotion,2
715,82,6," In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents .

716,82,7," That is , your commission . ",no emotion,1
717,82,8," Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . ",no emotion,1
718,82,9, Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . ,no emotion,1
719,82,10," The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . ",no emotion,1
720,82,11," According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? ",no emotion,2
721,82,12," We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . ",no emotion,3
722,82,13," We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... ",no emotion,4
723,82,14, Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? ,no emotion,2
724,82,15," Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . ",no emotion,1
725,82,16," Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . ",no emotion,1
726,82,17," Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . ",no emotion,3
727,82,18," Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? ",no emotion,2
728,82,19," Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . ",no emotion,3
729,82,20," All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . ",no emotion,4

741,84,6, How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan . ,no emotion,2

1729,208,4," Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! ",no emotion,2
1730,208,5," Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . ",no emotion,1
1731,208,6, Great ! I ’ ll take it . ,happiness,3
1732,208,7, Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! ,no emotion,3
1733,208,8, I understand . Thank you very much ! ,no emotion,4
1734,208,9, Have a great trip . ,happiness,1
1735,209,0,I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend . ,no emotion,1
1736,209,1, A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? ,no emotion,2
1737,209,2, The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . ,no emotion,1
1738,209,3, So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? ,no emotion,2
1739,209,4, It sounds like it will be . ,no emotion,1
1740,209,5, I really hope it doesn't get cold . ,no emotion,1
1741,209,6," That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . ",no emotion,1
1742,209,7," The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . ",no emotion,1
1743,209,8, That is true . The weather is constantly changing . ,no emotion,1
1744,209,9, It would be nice if the weather would never change . ,no emotion,1
1745,209,10," That would be great , then we could plan things sooner . ",no emotion,1
1746,209,11, True . Predictable weather would make life easier . ,no emotion,1
1747,210,0,"Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . ",no emotion,1
1748,210,1," If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . ",no emotion,1
1749,210,2," Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . ",no emotion,1
1750,210,3," But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . ",no emotion,1
1751,210,4, I doubt that . ,no emotion,1
1752,211,0,Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? ,no emotion,2
1753,211,1," Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . ",no emotion,1
1754,211,2," You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . ",no emotion,1
1755,211,3, What's special about these things ? ,no emotion,2
1756,211,4," Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . ",no emotion,1
1757,211,5, Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . ,happiness,1
1758,212,0,"I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . ",sadness,1

1760,212,2," Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . ",sadness,1
1761,212,3, Is that so ? ,surprise,2
1762,212,4," Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . ",no emotion,1
1763,212,5, Have you decided ? ,no emotion,2
1764,212,6, Yes . I want to get a better job . ,no emotion,1
1765,212,7, Could you tell me why you want to quit ? ,no emotion,2
1766,212,8, I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . ,no emotion,1
1767,212,9," Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? ",no emotion,2
1768,212,10, I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . ,no emotion,1
1769,212,11," OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . ",no emotion,1
1770,212,12, Thank you so much for your advice . ,no emotion,1
1771,212,13, And every best wish for your new job . ,no emotion,1
1772,212,14, Thank you . ,no emotion,1

1779,213,6, All right . ,no emotion,4
1780,214,0,"So , how should we get to the theatre ? ",no emotion,2
1781,214,1, Let's take the bus . ,no emotion,1
1782,214,2," I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . ",anger,1
1783,214,3, It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . ,no emotion,1
1784,214,4," It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . ",anger,1
1785,214,5," We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . ",no emotion,1
1786,214,6," Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . ",no emotion,1
1787,214,7," If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? ",no emotion,3
1788,214,8," We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . ",no emotion,4
1789,214,9, I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . ,no emotion,3
1790,214,10, Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . ,no emotion,4
1791,214,11, It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . ,no emotion,3
1792,214,12," Thanks , that was nice of you . ",happiness,4
1793,214,13," See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! ",no emotion,1
1794,215,0,Let's go over this plan again . ,no emotion,3
1795,215,1," From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg . ",no emotion,1
1796,215,2," And that is mostly flat , right ? ",no emotion,2
1797,215,3," Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . ",no emotion,1
1798,215,4," And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? ",no emotion,2
1799,215,5, That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop . ,no emotion,1
1800,215,6," It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . ",no emotion,1
1801,215,7, Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? ,no emotion,3
1802,216,0,"Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? ",no emotion,2
1803,216,1, I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her . ,anger,3
1804,216,2," I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet . ",no emotion,4
1805,216,3," Anyhow , I'd like to change our room . ",no emotion,3
1806,216,4," No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from . ",no emotion,3

Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . ",no emotion,1

5055,636,5, And ? ,no emotion,2
5056,636,6, So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . ,no emotion,1
5057,636,7, And it's a brick ? ,no emotion,2
5058,636,8, Yes . ,no emotion,1
5059,636,9, I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? ,no emotion,2
5060,636,10," I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . ",no emotion,1
5061,636,11, So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . ,no emotion,1
5062,636,12," Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . ",no emotion,1
5063,636,13, But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? ,no emotion,2
5064,636,14, He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . ,no emotion,1
5065,636,15," Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! ",no emotion,1
5066,636,16," C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . ",no emotion,1
5067,636,17, That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . ,no emotion,1
5068,636,18," You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? ",no emotion,2
